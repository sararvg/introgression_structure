# Initial populations simulated with Easypop

The file includes the simulated initial populations A and B obtained with Easypop, divided in folders considering the differentiation (Fst) between the two populations and the maximum number of alleles per locus. Each folder is labelled as Fxx_Axx, where F represents the value of Fst and A the maximum number of alleles.
